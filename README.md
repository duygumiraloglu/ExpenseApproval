The purpose of this project is to develop a software application to automate and improve the expense approval process of a business organization. 
The application aims to provide a platform for employees to record their expenses and track the approval stages of these expenses.

Key components and functionalities of the project:

User Authentication: The application includes a username and password authentication mechanism to ensure that each user can securely log in.
Additionally, users can perform a password reset if they forget their passwords.

Expense Form Creation and Editing: Employees can create expense forms through the application. 
These forms include basic information such as expense type, amount, and purpose. Employees can also edit forms they have previously created.

Approval Process: Expense forms, once created by an employee, are sequentially submitted for approval by a manager and then by the accounting department. 
Managers can view pending approval expense forms and approve or reject them.

Accounting Operations: Accounting authorities can view expense forms that have been approved by managers and proceed with the payment process. 
When a payment is made, a notification is sent to the respective employee.

User Interface and User Experience: The application offers a user-friendly interface to ensure easy access for employees and managers. 
It is designed to facilitate efficient and straightforward transaction processes.

Security and Data Privacy: The application incorporates necessary security measures to safeguard user information and expense data. 
Only authorized users can access and perform transactions, ensuring protection against unauthorized access
